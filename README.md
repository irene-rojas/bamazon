aka, Irene's Animal House

This is a command-line project created for the fall 2018 full-stack web development class at George Washington University. 

It is an Amazon-type store, where the customer requests a product, and the store sells it if it's in stock. 

I have attached screenshots of the game in progress.

This is the store's inventory when fully stocked.
